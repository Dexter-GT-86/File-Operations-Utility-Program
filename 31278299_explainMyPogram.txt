/*description of my program:
	first you need to compile the program by gcc
	THis program is for operating the file in low io condition.
	task 1 is to print the first 10 lines of sample.txt on terminal.
		you can access this by command ./a.out 
		
	task 2 is to chose the file we want to print first 10 lines from the file we choose
		you can access this by command ./a.out a.txt
		
	task 3 is to make the copy of file and it holds the first 10 lines of the original file
		you can access this by command ./a.out a.txt -d /home/student/Desktop
	
	task 4 is to choose the length of the lines we want to print or copy
		you can access this by command ./a.out a.txt -n 5
	
	task 5 is to print or copy the last 10 lines of the file
		you can access this by command ./a.out -L
	
	Above all, I complete all these five tasks each. But when I see the 5.6 I find it need to 
	operate the combination of these arguments("-L" "-n" "-d"). I have to admit that my pogram
	can only operate comment with the argc less than 5.
